        - Test this endpoint in the [playground](https://chat.pearch.ai/api-search/new)
        - Check out official [Python client](https://github.com/Pearch-ai/pearch-client)        
        
        Run a search query. This accepts a natural language query as `query` parameter along with additional settings. It returns a list of profiles that match the query and orders them by relevance.
        The query can be a simple search query like "software engineer from Ohio" or a more complex query like "Find me engineers in California speaking at least basic english working in software industry with experience at FAANG with 2+ years of experience and at least 500 followers and at least BS degree".
        Use parameters to control tradeoffs between speed and quality. Here are some recipes:        
        - For highest quality results (30-180 seconds) use pro search with insights and profile scoring enabled: `{"query": "<YOUR QUERY HERE>", "type": "pro", "insights": true, "profile_scoring": true}`
        - For medium to high quality results use "fast" search (<30s). `{"query": "<YOUR QUERY HERE>", "type": "fast", "insights": true, "profile_scoring": true}`
        - If you want to implement pagination, pass the `thread_id` of the previous request to the next request with increased `limit`. 

        Check out other parameters below to adjust speed vs quality and additional data that can be returned by the endpoint. 

        **Cost: (number of profiles returned) × (sum of credits for each of `type`, `insights`, `profile_scoring`, `high_freshness`, `reveal_emails`, `reveal_phones`)**

Running a search with the same `thread_id` and same `limit` as the previous request will return the same results as before without incurring additional charges."

        OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint that performs streaming search. 
        This endpoint accepts the standard OpenAI chat completions format and returns search results in a streaming format.
        
        The endpoint extracts the query from the last user message in the `messages` array and performs a search. 
        All search parameters are passed via the `extra_body` field.
        
        **Important**: This endpoint always returns a streaming response (SSE format), even when `stream=False` is specified.
        You should always use `stream=True` and process the response as a stream.
        
        The response format follows OpenAI's streaming chat completions format, making it compatible with OpenAI client libraries.
        
        **Example:**
        ```python
        from openai import OpenAI
        
        client = OpenAI(
            base_url="https://api.pearch.ai/",
            api_key="your-api-key"
        )
        
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="pearch",
            stream=True,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "software engineers at Google with 10 years of experience"}],
            extra_body={
                "limit": 5,
                "type": "fast",
                "stream_profiles": "batch",
                "final_result": True
            }
        )
        
        for chunk in stream:
            if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:
                delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
                if delta and delta.content:
                    print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)
                if chunk.choices[0].finish_reason is not None:
                    print(f"\nFinished: {chunk.choices[0].finish_reason}")
        ```
        
        **Available Parameters in `extra_body`:**
        - `limit`: Maximum number of results (1-1000, default: 10)
        - `type`: Search type - "fast" (1 credit/candidate), or "pro" (5 credits/candidate)

        - `high_freshness`: Enable real-time updates (2 credits/candidate)
        - `profile_scoring`: Enable profile scoring (1 credit/candidate)
        - `custom_filters`: Custom filters in JSON format for advanced filtering (see CustomFilters schema for all available fields including locations, languages, titles, industries, companies, universities, keywords, experience ranges, age ranges, follower counts, degrees, and more)
        - `strict_filters`: Be stricter when filtering (boolean, default: false)
        - `filter_out_no_emails`: Only return profiles with at least one email address (1 credit/candidate). Deprecated name: `require_emails`
        - `reveal_emails`: Include email addresses (2 credits/candidate, only if available). Deprecated name: `show_emails`
        - `filter_out_no_phones`: Only return profiles with at least one phone number (1 credit/candidate). Deprecated name: `require_phone_numbers`
        - `filter_out_no_phones_or_emails`: Only return profiles with at least one phone number OR email address (1 credit/candidate). Deprecated name: `require_phones_or_emails`
        - `reveal_phones`: Include phone numbers (14 credits/candidate, only if available). Deprecated name: `show_phone_numbers`
        - `docid_blacklist`: List of profile docids to exclude from search results
        - `docid_whitelist`: List of profile docids to limit search results to
        
        **Cost: (number of profiles returned) × (sum of credits for each of `type`, `insights`, `profile_scoring`, `high_freshness`, `reveal_emails`, `reveal_phones`)**

        - Test this endpoint in the [playground](https://chat.pearch.ai/api-leads-search/new)

        Endpoint for finding companies and related leads within those companies. Primary use case is for B2B sales, but can also be used for headhunting/executive search. It uses natural language query and returns a list of most relevant companies. Allows for generation of personalized outreach messages for the identified leads. Main difference with [/v2/search](/reference/post_v2-search) is that the search starts with shortlisting relevant companies first, then finding leads who necessarily activaly work at these companies.
        Some recipes:
        - When you only need companies, pass only the company query: `{"company_query": "manufacturers of aviation parts"}`
        - When you need companies and leads, pass both company and lead queries. Note that the lead query shouldn't include company requirements: `{"company_query": "manufacturers of aviation parts", "lead_query": "CTOs and engineering managers"}`
        - When you want to generate personalized outreach messages for the identified leads, pass the outreach message instruction: `{"company_query": "manufacturers of aviation parts", "lead_query": "CTOs and engineering managers", "outreach_message_instruction": "Suggest buying my (Rob) SaaS recruitment product <300 characters, email style, casual, personal touch"}`
        - if you don't have good intuition about leads to target, use a very broad lead query like `{..., "lead_query": "people who I can contact regarding partnerships or any c-level (CEO CFO COO CTO CIO CMO CHRO CPO CLO CSO) /founder/director/owner roles"}`
        
        **Cost: (number of companies returned) × (5 + `company_high_freshness` if enabled) + (number of leads returned) × (2 + sum of credits for `outreach_message_instruction`, `reveal_emails`, `reveal_phones`, `filter_out_no_emails`, `filter_out_no_phones`, `high_freshness`)**

        Submit a search query to be processed asynchronously in the background. This endpoint returns immediately with a task ID and thread ID that can be used to check the status, retrieve results when ready, and paginate through search results.
        
        This is useful for long-running searches that may take several minutes to complete. The search will continue processing in the background while you can use the task ID to monitor progress and retrieve results. The thread ID can be used for pagination and follow-up searches by passing it in subsequent requests to either `/v2/search` or `/v2/search/submit`.
        
        All the same search parameters are supported as the synchronous `/v2/search` endpoint, including `thread_id` for continuation and pagination.

The query can be a simple search query like "software engineer from Ohio" or a more complex query like "Find me engineers in California speaking at least basic english working in software industry with experience at FAANG with 2+ years of experience and at least 500 followers and at least BS degree". Query parameter can handle full job descriptions, but passing specific subset of important requirements normally works better

There are now two alternative ways to call with `thread_id`: (1) with an increased `limit` and an empty or omitted `query`, to request more results (in this case results are appended, and you are only charged for additional, new results) or (2) with a new `query` to perform a follow-up conversational search; in this case, the new query should only specify additional requirements or changes as in a natural conversation, and the results are replaced instead of appended. Running a search with the same `thread_id` and same `limit` as the previous request will return the same results as before without incurring additional charges."

        Accepts a profile (arbitrary JSON), and returns a list of jobs relevant to the provided profile. 
        This endpoint is used in conjunction with `/v1/find_matching_jobs` endpoint. 
        1. First you need to upsert jobs with [/v1/upsert_jobs](/reference/post_v1-upsert-jobs)
        2. Then you can use [/v1/find_matching_jobs](/reference/post_v1-find-matching-jobs) to find jobs relevant to a profile.        

        **Cost: 1 credit per found job**

        Retrieve enriched user profile based on the provided Linkedin profile ID or email address as a query parameter. Linkedin profile ID is the part that comes after `https://www.linkedin.com/in/` in the profile URL.
        
        You can provide either `docid` (LinkedIn profile ID) or `email`. If only `email` is provided, the system will attempt to resolve it to a LinkedIn profile.

        **Cost: 1 credit + extra credits for each of `high_freshness`, `reveal_emails`, `reveal_phones` and `with_profile` parameters if enabled. Email lookup adds +1 credit.**

    CustomFilters:
      type: object
      description: |
        Custom filters in JSON format for advanced filtering. Leave empty to use default filtering logic. 
        Format: `{"filter_name1": ["value1", "value2"], "filter_name2": ["value3", "value4"], ...}`. 
        
        Filtering logic: Conditions between different keys are joined with "AND", so all conditions must pass. Within each condition, we always use "OR". For example, `{"titles": ["swe", "mle"]}` means the profile must have either "swe" OR "mle" as a title. If you specify multiple keys like `{"titles": ["swe", "mle"], "locations": ["San Francisco"]}`, the profile must match at least one title (swe OR mle) AND be in San Francisco.
        
        Use any string values as is. Pearch.ai internally correctly matches them to profile data. E.g. you may pass `{"industries": "health"}` to filter for profiles in health industry, this will be correctly mapped to pearch.ai internal `healthcare` industry. 
        If you want to force no filtering at all (`custom_filters` or default filters), pass empty object `"custom_filters": {}`. This will speed up search, increase recall at some relevancy cost.
